  ## Description
  Automation made using playwright that will filter and save house listings with the user's own provided price, bed and bath options and zip code

  ## Installation
  ```
  npm i
  ```

  ## Usage
  1. [Need to have an account on zillow]
  2. [On line 9 - 15 add/replace with your email, password, city, zipcode and filtering preferences]

  I made this as a learning experience using playwright, its functional but still in development for further improvements.
  It will only run firefox web browser for the automation because bot detection is quicker on Chrome.

  ## Test
  ```
  npx playwright test tests/zillow-automation.spec.js --headed
  ```
